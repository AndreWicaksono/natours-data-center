Natours Data Center was created using Natours product ideas from Udemy courses: [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) (by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/#instructor-1)). And for the UI design, it uses The Wild Oasis project from [The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) (by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/#instructor-1)).
